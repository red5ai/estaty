# Proximity analysis

In this section scripts for "Proximity analysis" use case are prepared. 
Proximity analysis is an analysis of the availability of infrastructural facilities on the real estate object

## Calculation description

The calculation is based on the OSM road graph. Using this graph, routes to each geographical object are created

## Scripts 

Three scripts have been prepared for this use case:

- [path_to_bars.py](path_to_bars.py) - calculate the routes to the bars using OpenStreetMap data
- [path_to_parks.py](path_to_parks.py) - calculate the routes to the parks using OpenStreetMap data
- [path_to_parks_with_quercus.py](path_to_parks_with_quercus.py) - calculate the routes to the parks (OpenStreetMap data)
